## About

- This is the capstone project of the Ruby on Rails section at 
[Microverse](https://microverse.org). It is a fully functional web app, 
mimicking aspects of Twitter. 

### Built with

- VSCode
- Ruby on Rails
- TailwindCSS
- SQLite
- Rubocop
- RSpec, FactoryBot, ShouldaMatchers, Capybara

## Getting started

- Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and 
[Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/). You will need at least versions 2.6.5 and
6 respectively.
- Fork the repository and download it to your machine.

## Setup

- Run `bundle` to install all the required gems. 
- Run `rails db:migrate db:seed` to create the tables and populate with a few
users, posts, and followers. You can check `db/seeds.rb` to see a basic example.

#### TailwindCSS 
Configuration is 
already done but you can take a look at it's [github repo](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/tailwindcss-rails) if you're interested. As for the classes, here's a 
neat little [cheatsheet](https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet) to get you
started, and you can always check their [official page](https://tailwindcss.com/).
This is my first project using it, and I'm already in love!

## Usage

- Run `rails server` to start your local server and go to `localhost:3000` or
whatever is your set port.
- Log in with username: `test_user` to have a look around, or create your own 
account.
- You can follow/unfollow users, create posts and see posts of followed users on your timeline, and upload a profile picture and cover image.
